# A description and problem 
Actually I have made a game in which the play pulls the ball with a slingshot effect 
and with the precise hit and at accurate place at the ememies the player can collect
points and kills and if te player hits the green enemies the playes dies.....

# The problem which I am running into
I have kept it like the camera/view will be equal or according to the ball's position
whenever i am dragging the ball inspite of the ball launching from the place where it is.
The mouse is going back to initial position...
I mean that the mouse's X & Y positions should modify/update with the ball and mouse position......
